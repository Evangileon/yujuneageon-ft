Humans long believed that there were other beings in the universe.  It was too hard to imagine such a vast, vibrant universe entirely barren save a small speck in the Milky Way galaxy.

Unfortunately, there was a constant, depressing lack of evidence.  Many wise men theorized explanations for humanity's lonely corner of the universe, but no technology existed for determining the truth.  Man was to be alone until he found a way to contact others.

Those wishing for contact with other beings created their own visions of what might be waiting far away in the deep.  Many wished for contact with intelligent, kind races with the resources to take humanity under their wing.  Others created fantasies of horrible monsters bent on the destruction, enslavement or exploitation of man.  A few realized that alien life would be so foreign that it might not even be recognized as such.  Would these alien races even be willing or capable of communication with Earth?

No one dared imagine the truth behind the galaxy's stony silence.

The amount of space in the universe is so vast that our comprehension may never be able to accept it.  As we began to colonize other planets around Sol, and eventually other stars, our understanding of the universe and our control over it grew.  We could travel between stars and protect ourselves from the dangers of open space, but still couldn't seem to see deep enough into the universe to glimpse other beings.

After the first colonials left Earth and encountered nothing but empty planets, humanity began to come to terms with isolation.  The view that there must be others finally began to fade, as scientists and dreamers could think of no other method for finding life signs on other planets.  Automated exploration units found nothing but barren, hostile worlds.  Exciting insights into the workings of the universe were often found, but none of them led to signs of other life.

Of course, in a galaxy consisting of over 100,000,000,000 stars, it's difficult to conclusively prove that no human will ever encounter new life signs.  In all the astronomers' years of study, fewer than 10,000 star systems in the Milky Way had actually been carefully scrutinized.  Space was just too big...


Initial colonization of new solar systems was slow and painful.  Relying on propulsion systems capable of travel at only .10 c, colonists could expect to spend months or years traveling to their destinations.  A tenth the speed of light is simply crawling - on solar and galaxy scales.  These long periods in open space led to great advancements in transport technologies, and safety was only a concern for the very first groups of explorers.  It appeared that man could travel as far as he wanted, so long as he had the patience.

Propulsion systems finally began to make strides, but only after physicists were able to unify theories of gravity with those of the other universal energies.  These theories opened wide a huge host of potential technologies, but the planning, calculation and manufacturing processes necessary to explore them was a significant hinderance.  Engineers promised that they would be inventing new devices, but warned that each might take months or years to perfect.

The first set of new propulsion devices allowed travel at .20 c, and exploratory transports were soon traveling at more than .25 c.  The significance of this advancement was enormous...and unfortunate.  Almost overnight, colonists were able to travel three times further from Sol than ever before.  The ancient alien ruins were located on one of the first distant planets identified for colonization.

Dispite the continued lack of live alien beings, this discovery fundamentally altered almost every aspect of society.  Nearly limitless resources were put forward to research the new solar system.  There were innumerable questions to be answered, and humanity again believed that contact with other races was just around the corner.

It was soon found that all the planets in the system had been used by the alien race.  They were, indeed, alien, and little information had been garnered regarding what they had been like.  In many locations, it appeared as if they had simply disappeared, while other portions of their planets were horribly ravaged.  On one of the warmer planets, only slightly less hospitable than the Earth, most items had been almost perfectly preserved.  Archeologists hoped to find some physical remains of an alien body there, but no traces could be found.  Many structures and artifacts seemed to be in working order, but no organic remains had survived.

In fact, it was one of the ravaged areas that yielded the first evidence of life - the remains of a humanoid-like creature.  So much time had passed since the creature died that the surrounding area gave no clues as to the cause of death.  However, it was well preserved and intact enough for biologists to study.  Chemical composition tests indicated the alien had died approximately 100,000 years earlier.

The biologists rushed out of the lab only minutes after entering.  The remains found on the planet so closely matched a human corpse that it was unlikely to be anything else.  Skeptics and conspiracy theorists immediately demanded access to all the samples and data, but no other realistic conclusions could be reached.  Somehow, humanity had been on the planet thousands of years before Earth men had even visited their own moon.
